# Project Status Index

Canonical entry point. Auto-updated by `atomic-skills:project`. Read first every session.

This repo follows a 3-level model under `projects/<project-id>/`:

- **Plan** — multi-phase project with narrative, principles, phases, exit gates (`<plan-slug>/plan.md`)
- **Initiative** — one phase of a plan (`<plan-slug>/phases/f<N>-<slug>.md`). A standalone unit of work is a degenerate 1-phase plan (same nested shape).
- **Task** — atomic action inside a phase initiative (lives in its frontmatter `tasks[]`)

(Legacy/un-migrated trees may still carry flat `plans/<slug>.md` + `initiatives/<slug>.md`; `atomic-skills:project migrate` cuts them over.)

## Active Plans

_(none yet — run `atomic-skills:project new plan <slug>` to bootstrap interactively,
`atomic-skills:project adopt <plan-file.md>` to capture an existing plan,
or `atomic-skills:project discover` to scan repo for in-flight work)_

## Active Initiatives (standalone)
